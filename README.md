# US Crime Shows Quiz
The aim of the US Crime Shows Quiz is to test the knowledge of popular crime shows fanatic in a fun, interactive and simple way.
<br>

The site is aimed people interested in testing their knowledge of popular fiction crime shows with questions related to specific episodes, characters and actors. The site includes an instructions page ensuring end users understand how to play the quiz and what to expect as they enter the quiz area. 

You will see on the website the use of typical crime show colours and fonts learnt through my own experiences watching crime shows and partaking in similar quizes as research towards this project.

The site has a clean, simple design with a green, black and white colour pallete to match the asthetic of crime shows like CSI: Miami.
